# MPCStats: Privacy-Preserving Statistics Infrastructure

> This project has been sunset and is no longer actively maintained.

MPCStats was a [PSE project](https://pse.dev/en/projects/mpc-stats) focused on making privacy-preserving statistical analysis both practical and accurate. We built a [demo at Devcon 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCp7Zsjou7w) using MP-SPDZ and TLSNotary, allowing users to share their ETH balance on Binance and derive statistical insights from the aggregated data. The demo infrastructure could be adapted and deployed to support other data sources and produce different statistical analyses.
